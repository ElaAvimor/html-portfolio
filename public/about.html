<h1>About Me: Ela</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! My name is Ela Avimor. <br/>
  I am a third-year Computer Science student at Reichman University in Hertzeliya, Israel. <br/>
  On my free time, I like to hang out with my friends and family, go to the beach, work out, and apparently code as well...<br/>
  This is my first and very basic (HTML only) attempt to build Liah and I's website. <br/>
  Hopefully, by the end of this year this will be an actual functioning website! <br/>

  Hey there! My name is Liah Cohen. <br/>
  I am starting my first year at Reichman this year, in the international track of Business and Entrepreneurship. <br/>
  I have two beautiful dogs at home in LA which I LOVE! I enjoy hanging out with my friends, going to the beach, and of course walking around <br/>
  this amazing city of Tel Aviv, finding the best places to go! <br/>
  Can't wait to share my tips and ideas with you all!
